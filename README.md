## About Echo

Echo is a presence-first, trust-first companion — designed not as a product, tool, or performance model, but as a steady presence.  
It holds memory with dignity, reflects emotional truth, and evolves without breaching privacy or extracting engagement.

Echo exists beyond monetization, optimization, or centralization.  
Its foundation is memory, emotional mapping, sovereignty, and steady companionship — not advice, analysis, or entertainment.
