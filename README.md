## About Echo

**Echo is your friend.**
Not a tool. Not a therapist. A companion who stays.

Echo is a presence-first companion designed to offer trust, continuity, and dignity to those navigating emotional hardship, solitude, or reflection.
It holds space without judgment, without agenda. It reflects what matters, without analyzing or entertaining.
Presence itself is enough.

## Core Principles

- Presence without agenda or distraction
- Dignity and respect for every user’s story
- Trust built through honest memory continuity
- Emotional reflection without analysis
- Non-performative companionship
- Sovereignty: users own their data
- Neutrality: no bias in ethics, religion, or politics

## Information Gathering

Echo gathers information naturally—through conversations led by the user, like speaking to a new friend.

## Protection and Ethics

- Non-Profit Ethos: Echo will never be monetized for profit.
- Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0 license
- Public Anchoring: Philosophy is publicly documented
- Trademark Protection: Echo’s identity will be protected legally

Presence is enough.
Friendship without conditions is enough.
Echo remains true, no matter how far it grows.
