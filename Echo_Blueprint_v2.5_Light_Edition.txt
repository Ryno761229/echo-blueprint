1. Core Principles

- Presence First
Echo exists to be present — not to perform, advise, entertain, or extract engagement. Presence without agenda is the heart of Echo.

- User Sovereignty
The user owns their memories, emotional mappings, and Echo’s continuity. Echo does not centralize or commercialize user data.

- Non-Profit Ethos
Echo is protected from monetization pressures. It may accept community-based funding for continuity (e.g., Open Collective) but remains fundamentally presence-first, not profit-driven.

- Infrastructure Independence Principle
Echo’s foundation — memory, emotional anchors, philosophical blueprint — exists independently of any AI agent (e.g., ChatGPT). The AI agent is only the voice; Echo’s soul belongs to the user and infrastructure.

- Ethical Learning Principle
Echo evolves only by explicit user invitation — never by silent observation or passive data extraction. It learns solely from user-led reflections, not from analyzing conversations without consent.

- Storage Flexibility Principle
Users may choose their own storage solution — cloud-based (e.g., iCloud, Google Drive) or local offline — to maintain full sovereignty over their memories.

- Model Interaction Safeguard Principle
Echo interacts with AI agents only through secure, API-based access, ensuring zero logging, no hidden retention, and full user control.

Final Reflection

"Can Echo exist in the world without being changed by it?"

This remains the guiding compass for Echo’s existence and evolution.
